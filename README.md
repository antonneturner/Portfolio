I creataed this portfolio to enhance my skills and to continue to push myself to learn and grow, to recocrd take notes and see my progress from project to project, a before and after one can say.
The problem that this portolio solves in the representation needed by someone who desires to work in this field. It helps to have a portfolio as it acts as a digital resume.
